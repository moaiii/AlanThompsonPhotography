# AlanThompsonPhotography
Gallery Website for Alan Thompson (Munich Photographer)

Single page gallery application which uses a basic bootstrap template for the skeletal structure. 
Ive used some Javascript to auto-scroll to page sections. 
Masory plugin used to tile the gallery wall in neat vertical slices independent of photo height. 

TODO (Errors):
Header for the 'about' section being cut off when auto-scrolled. Padding fix required in CSS?
